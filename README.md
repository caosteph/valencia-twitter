# Understanding the Population of a Modern City Through Twitter

## Aims

In this study, we will employ the natural language processing (NLP) technique
of topic modeling using BERTopic in order to analyze a large data set of Tweets including
the word or hashtag “Valencia.” Topic modeling will allow us to extract the
most relevant topics being discussed by Valencian citizens. By applying this
analysis to the entire data set in addition to the most recently posted Tweets,
we can determine what issues have been around for a long time, and which
have arisen only recently and might be more time sensitive. Thus, we will be
able to gain insight into long-term and short-term issues, as well as learn about
what citizens are already satisfied with.

## Study Abstract
This paper examines the use of Twitter data to understand the interests
of a modern Spanish city. The study focuses on extracting the most pop-
ular topics discussed by the citizens in Valencia by applying the natural
language processing technique, topic modeling, to process and classify the
tweets. The paper also includes an analysis of the most frequent words
and topics discussed on Twitter by the users in the city, and what insights
they may provide to city decision-makers. The study demonstrates the
potential of social media data analysis in understanding urban popula-
tions and informing policy-making decisions. The results indicate that
the frequency of some of the topics that are being discussed on Twitter
reflect the ongoing events in Valencia, however, the majority remain sta-
ble over time. The findings of this research have implications for urban
planners, marketers, and policymakers in developing effective strate-
gies for engaging with city residents. In this paper sentiment analysis
is not being discussed which could be an area for further research
